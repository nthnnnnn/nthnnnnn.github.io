A video editor portfolio website is a website that showcases the work of a video editor. It is a great way for video editors to show off their skills and experience to potential clients. A well-designed video portfolio website can help a video editor stand out from the competition and land more work / clients.

When creating a video portfolio website, it is important to design / develop a website that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate (which would create a great user experience). The site is very informative as well as nicely organized, with each video clearly labeled and described.

Some of the key elements that went when developing this video portfolio website:

1. Making sure website is mobile-friendly / responsive. More and more people are using their smartphones and tablets to browse the web, so it's important to make sure your website looks good and functions properly on all devices.
2. It's also a well-organized, with each video clearly labeled and described.
3. The website also include a contact form, so potential clients can get in touch with the editor (it also includes a form validation).
4. Videos used in this website are been fetched from a video platform like Vimeo or YouTube. Ofcourse u cant see their default video player because i replaced it with the custom play button.
5. Animation of the personal intro that starts at the very first load of the website displaying the clients name and video shows up with name.(the animation part) 
6. Maintaining the height of the landing page video across every screen size.
7.  The website also include a variety of videos, showcasing the editor's skills in different areas, such as editing, color grading, and motion/timing.

Technology used in this project.
1. HTML.
2. CSS (SCSS).
3. JAVASCRIPT.
4. SOME OTHER LIBRARY.

**NOTE**
(The reason i used the above technology and not any framework/library because i wanted to explore the vanilla js and how can i achieve a site using the above three technology. Gained knowledge in module bundling and ES6 import export)
